# Leaf Clustering and Classification using the K-means Algorithm
Leaf classification is a fundamental task with numerous real-world applications, ranging from botany and environmental science to agriculture and bioinformatics. The objective of our analysis is to employ K-Means clustering to group leaves based on various morphological and textural attributes, including Eccentricity, Aspect Ratio, Elongation, Solidity, Convexity, Isoperimetric Factor, Depth, Lobedness, Intensity, Contrast, Smoothness, Third moment, Uniformity, and Entropy. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover inherent patterns within the dataset, facilitating the automatic identification and categorization of plant species by their leaves. Specifically, we seek to answer questions related to the natural grouping of leaves based on these attributes and understand whether these attributes can effectively distinguish different species of plants. This analysis will aid in botanical research, species classification, and potentially contribute to our understanding of plant diversity.

The problem domain of this analysis centers on botany and plant classification. Accurate classification and identification of plant species are crucial for various fields, including agriculture, ecology, and environmental science. Understanding the unique features that distinguish different species of leaves is fundamental for plant taxonomy and can also have practical applications in species conservation and horticulture. It is estimated that there are over 390,000 plant species known to science, and new discoveries continue to expand our knowledge. Accurate and efficient species identification can help researchers and botanists manage and protect plant diversity, as well as contribute to ecosystem preservation and sustainable agriculture.

The choice of k-Means clustering as the analytical method is justified by its suitability for unsupervised pattern recognition and clustering. K-means clustering is particularly relevant for this problem because it can identify natural groupings within the leaf dataset without any prior information about the species or categories. By applying k-means, we aim to uncover inherent structures and similarities among the leaves based on their morphological features, which can lead to the classification of leaves into distinct clusters. This method is well-suited for exploring the dataset's inherent variability and will allow us to observe whether certain features are strong indicators of species categorization. Ultimately, the results of this analysis will contribute to the field of botany by providing insights into leaf diversity and aiding in the identification and classification of plant species based on morphological attributes.

# Understanding the Data
The dataset consists of a collection of shape and texture features extracted from digital images of leaf specimens originating from a total of 40 different plant species, harvesting an average number of 16 leaf specimens from each plant. There are 340 observations and 16 study variables in total.

# K-means Clustering Algorithm
K-Means is a well-established unsupervised learning algorithm used for solving the clustering problem. This method offers a straightforward approach to classify a given dataset into a predefined number of clusters (k). The core concept involves determining k centroids, one for each cluster, and strategically placing them to maximize their separation. The goal is to assign each data point to its nearest centroid. When all points have been assigned, the initial grouping is complete. Subsequently, new centroids are computed as the barycenter of the clusters formed in the previous step. This process is iterated until the centroids no longer change, indicating convergence.

During this iterative process, the centroids gradually settle into their final positions. In other words, they stop moving, signifying the end of the K-Means clustering procedure. This method yields a set of distinct, non-overlapping clusters, providing a valuable tool for data analysis and pattern recognition. K-Means is numerical, unsupervised, and works through iterative refinement. It is particularly useful for segmenting data into groups with minimal intragroup variability and maximum intergroup separation. Moreover, it is commonly applied in various domains, including image segmentation, where it is a popular choice for dividing images into meaningful regions.

There are always K clusters. There is always at least one item in each cluster. The clusters are non-hierarchical, and they do not overlap. Every member of a cluster is closer to its cluster than any other cluster because closeness does not always involve the ‘centre’ of clusters. The k-means clustering is a method of cluster analysis which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

# Model Fitting
The dataset was divided into training and test set using R code, after which we perform the neural network model and evaluate the confusion matrix with model methods such as sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value, negative prediction value, and prevalence of the data.

# Summary
This study explores the utilization of k-means algorithms to analyze herbal leaf species, focusing on assessing the similarity between different leaves based on key features, including color and shape. The k-means algorithm offers a straightforward approach, making it suitable for handling large datasets. It also presents an uncomplicated process, requiring users to specify the number of clusters (k). To determine the optimal number of clusters, we employed several methods, including Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WSS), Gap Statistics, and the Silhouette method. Our analysis consistently identified k = 2 as the optimal number of clusters for most of the datasets. Additionally, we discussed distribution analysis using bar charts for each plant leaf. The outcomes of this study aim to assist researchers and botanists who face challenges in identifying plant species due to variations in size, shape, and color. For smaller values of k the algorithms give good results. For larger values of k, the segmentation is very coarse many clusters appear in the images at discrete places. Different initial partitions can result in different final clusters .The advantage of K 
Means algorithm is simple and quite efficient. It works well when clusters are not well separated from each other.

# Limitations of the study
The main limitation of this study is to use the secondary database, future study should be done based on primary data for more accuracy of the results related to leaf identification.
It is incredibly costly and time-consuming to conduct a classification process and check for accuracy in the area of botany.
Furthermore, the dataset used in the study is limited in terms of the number of samples and, this may result in a loss of valuable information that could have contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the study.
It is hard to explain the detail of each attribute because there is no reference about this work. Because of that, we maybe make some misunderstanding to attributes.
The outcomes may change by the period and environment when the dataset is collected.
